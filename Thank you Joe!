Dear Joe,
I wanted to wish you a good summer! I’ll see you in the fall with physics and this time with a more motivated and focused outcome. I also wanted to thank you for all the wealth of knowledge you have provided to us and encouraging us to break stuff. On a personal note, I appreciate your flexibility through all the wackiness that occurred towards the end of the class. It really did help out a lot with stress and the course material especially the trickiness with things like PI’s not working or VM’s not working that were good distractions from other life stressors. I hope you have a good summer and thank you for your impact on students like me who came to that first class not expecting this outcome and these skills to be learned. I’m going to nmap the International Space Station now, I’ll let you know what I find!
Have a nice summer,
Derrick Clarke 
Also welcome to my github repo, I'll probably start saving OSINT tools I find on here and other projects. The OSINT stuff is really cool and I am glad you helped me start to investigate some of them.
